# Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Java 11 or higher: Spring Boot requires Java 11 or a later version.
Maven or Gradle: Depending on your build tool.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
IntelliJ IDEA
Eclipse
Visual Studio Code
Git: For cloning the repository.
Postman (optional, for testing API endpoints).

# Clone the Repository
Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/SanjayNewar7/employee_management

Navigate to your repository page,
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Copy the repository URL from the "Clone or Download" button.

# Import the Project into an IDE
Eclipse:
Open Eclipse.
Go to File > Import > Existing Maven Projects.
Navigate to the cloned repository and select it.
Click Finish, and Eclipse will automatically download the dependencies.

#  Set Up Application Properties
Locate the application.properties file in the src/main/resources directory.

Configure your application properties, such as database connection or email settings. Example configuration for a local environment:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database

spring.datasource.username=root

spring.datasource.password=your_password

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

spring.mail.host=smtp.mailtrap.io

spring.mail.port=587

spring.mail.username=root

spring.mail.password=

Update any necessary credentials such as database or email credentials.


#Testing the Application
After running the application, you can test the endpoints via Postman or Swagger (if configured).

Open Postman and set up API requests.
Test the endpoints such as:
POST /api/auth/register

POST /api/auth/login

GET /api/employees

Example:
Register User: POST to http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register

{

  "username": "ram",
  
  "password": "ram123"
  ,
  "role": "USER"
  
}
Login User: POST to http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login

{

  "username": "ram",
  
  "password": "ram123"
  
}
Get Employees: GET to http://localhost:8080/api/employees
